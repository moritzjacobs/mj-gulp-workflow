A fork of [zephir/zephir-gulp-workflow](https://github.com/zephir/zephir-gulp-workflow) with added sourcemaps and other things.

# differences to zephir-gulp-workflow:

## changed functionality
- sourcemaps
- broswerify
- pngquant
- `gulp cleanup` for file removal (sourcemaps)
- gulp-notify
- favicons

## conventions
- config files are located at the root of your `package.json` and are called `gulp-config.js` (not `compileConfig.js` as with `zephir-gulp-workflow`)
- sourcemaps are enabled for dev env by default
- pxToRem is removed
- es6 via babel and browserify are enabled for a specific task and source folder per default (`babel-preset-env` + browserstring)
- added imagemin options

## Installation

1. Create a package.json in your project **>>** `npm init`
2. Install dependencies **>>** `npm i --save-dev gulp mj-gulp-workflow`
3. Create a new `gulpfile.js` and add the content you find below

```js
require('mj-gulp-workflow')(require('gulp'));
```

## First run

run `gulp` to create a `gulp-config.js`, configure to taste.

## Configuration

tasks in `combinedTasks` are run in sequence, so if you want parallel execution you would have to put them in another array inside `combinedTasks`, e.g.:

```js
combinedTasks: {
	dist: ["es6", "js", "images", "svg", "css", "copy", "clean"], // runs sequential
	default: [["dist", "watch"]], // runs parallel
},
```

## Usage

Run `gulp dist --env dist` for distribution, otherwise just `gulp`.

## Dev

Dev server: `npm run testd`

Build with `npm run babel-dist`

Run tests witch `npm test`

Run test http server with `npm run testd` => <http://localhost:8080>, then look at the console.

# @todo:
- fix sourcemaps using babel and browserify
- reintroduce a way to mark `gulp-config.js` files as outdated and show instructional messages after an update
- patch vulnerabilities brought by `gulp-imagemin`, `rfg-api` and `cli-real-favicon` by updating or replacing these dependencies
